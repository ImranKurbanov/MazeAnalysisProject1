# AI Usage Declaration

## Overview
As permitted by the course policy, we utilized AI assistance (Gemini) for coding support, debugging, and boilerplate generation. All code provided by AI was reviewed, tested, and integrated manually by the team.

## Usage Details

| Component | AI Contribution | Human Contribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Structure** | Suggested package organization (Model, Algorithms, UI). | Implemented the actual folders and refactored files. |
| **JavaFX Boilerplate** | Generated initial `HelloApplication` and FXML layout code. | Customized UI elements, added buttons/dropdowns, and connected event handlers. |
| **Custom Data Structures** | Provided standard implementations for `MyStack`, `MyQueue`, and Binary Heap (`MyPriorityQueue`). | Reviewed logic to ensure understanding of pointer operations and heap properties. |
| **BenchmarkRunner** | Generated the loop structure for running repeated trials and writing to CSV. | Configured specific maze sizes (10, 50, 100, 200) and integrated correct solver calls. |

## Prompts Used
* "How to create a custom generic Stack in Java?"
* "JavaFX code for a canvas to draw a grid."
* "Algorithm for Prim's maze generation using a priority queue."
* "How to write a benchmark test in Java that saves to CSV."

## Verification
We certify that we understand every line of code in this project and can explain the implementation details of the custom data structures and algorithms during the oral defense.
